A short tutorial
================

In this section I provide a quick overview of the way the NimCfitsio
library should be used. We'll implement a program that dumps the
contents of a FITS file on the terminal in a nice format.

To use the library, you have to import it first:

.. code-block:: nim

    import cfitsio
